* Created an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills learned thus far. The app takes in orders from customers and depletes stock from the store's inventory.

* In addition, a manager specific interface was created to allow the viewing of all inventory, low inventory, adding more stock, and adding new products. Every edit that is saved is automatically updated to the bamazon database.
