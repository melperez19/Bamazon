# Bamazon - A Node.js & MySQL Application

Created an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills learned thus far. The app takes in orders from customers and depletes stock from the store's inventory. A manager specific interface was created as well to allow viewing all inventory, low inventory, adding more stock, and adding new products to the inventory. Every edit that is saved automatically updates the bamazon database.
